\section{Simulation Analysis}
\label{sec:simulation}
Since this circuit has a sinusoidal voltage source, the voltage and current values of the various components vary in time. Therefore, we must perform a transient analysis to simulate the circuit's total response. We also ran operating point analysis for both $t<0$ and $t=0$ to determine what the initial conditions were and establish the boundary conditions.
\subsection{Operating Point Analysis}
The tables below show the simulated operating point results for both $t<0$ (where we assume no current is flowing through the capacitor) and t=0 where we replace Vs for a short-circuit.

\subsection{Natural response}
In this section we simulate the natural response of the circuit using the computations from the previous section.

\subsection{Natural and forced response}
We repeat the previous step with vs(t) considering a frequency of 1kHz. Below is the plot for both the stimulus and the response.

\subsection{Frequency response}
After simulating the frequency response in node 6 we plotted the magnitude and phase of V6, Vc and Vs side by side.
