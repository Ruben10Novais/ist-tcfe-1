% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study the behaviour of a circuit containing 4 independent meshes and a total of 11 branches: an independent voltage source $V_A$, an independent current source $I_D$, a dependent current source $I_B$, and a dependent voltage source $V_C$, all connected to 7 resistances (from $R_1$ through to $R_7$). In order to determine the electrical variables (current and voltage) of each of it components, we will use different methods to determine these variables and we will compare the theoretical with experimental data. The circuit can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:rc}.

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit using both the mesh method and the node method is
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results in operating point are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are laid out in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
