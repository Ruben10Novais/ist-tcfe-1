\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this laboratory assignment we were successful in producing coherent calculations using the Octave Maths tool and the circuit simulation, done using the Ngspice tool. Static and transient analysis were performed both theoretically and using a circuit simulation. Some results in the simulation that were predicted to yield zero current or voltage were actually very slightly off - in the magnitude of 1e-15. This could be do to the writing and reading of the different text files truncating the numbers at specific decimal places. The whole report has been automatised and we're confident that it would yield consistent results with a new set of data.
